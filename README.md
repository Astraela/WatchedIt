# WatchedIt
 
I couldn't find a simple tool to track normal Movies/Series, imdb is too clustered, some had wacky databasess. 
Anyways, made my own ^^. 

You can add your own, it finds the posters through google images so I'm afraid it won't find any imagery if you're offline :(. Might make it so they're downloaded the first time.

You can also add Progress, so that you can easily remember you were at 45:32 while watching wall-e but had to go because you were going to the cinema to watch wall-e.

It also has a tray icon for easy editing. It shows the 3 most recently edited cards. You can edit the progress, increase season/episode by 1 or just quickly open the update window.
